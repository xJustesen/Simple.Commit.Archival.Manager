# 🤡 SCAM: Simple Commit & Archival Manager 🤡

**Because you don't need Git — you need a SCAM!**

---

## 🤡 What is SCAM?
SCAM is the most *unbelievably simple* version control system you'll ever use. It has two commands:

- `scam commit <filename> -m "message"`
- `scam push`

That’s it. No branches. No merges. No pull requests. No conflicts. No stress. Just pure, unregulated file dumping into a secret `.scam/` folder. 🚀

---

## 🧠 Why SCAM?

Because Git is hard. Here’s why SCAM is better:

- ✅ No merge conflicts
- ✅ No branches to remember
- ✅ No coworkers arguing in pull requests
- ✅ Every file gets timestamped (like a boss)
- ✅ All commits go to `.scam/`, because secrets are best kept hidden

> "SCAM saved my team. We now spend 100% less time on code reviews and 300% more time shipping bugs to production." – Definitely Not a Paid Actor

## 🚀 Installing

If you're using `uv`:

```bash
uv pip install --editable .
```

Or classic:

```bash
pip install --editable .
```

---

## 🛠 Usage

### Commit a file
```bash
scam commit my_cool_script.py -m "Added some spaghetti logic"
```
- Stores a timestamped copy in `.scam/`
- Logs your brilliant message to `log.jsonl`

### Push to the cloud (or pretend to)
```bash
scam push
```
- Mocks a cloud upload
- Logs the deception in `push.log`

## ❤️ Contributing
Please don’t. Or do. Honestly, we’re not even tracking it.

## 🧙‍♂️ License
MIT, because it would be a scam not to be.

SCAM: Because sometimes, you just want to commit crimes — not code.
